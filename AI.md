`GitHub Copilot has been an invaluable tool in the development of this project. By leveraging its AI-powered code suggestions, I was able to streamline the coding process and reduce the time spent on routine tasks. For instance, Copilot assisted in generating boilerplate code, such as constructors and method stubs, which allowed me to focus more on the core logic and functionality of the application. Its ability to understand the context and provide relevant code snippets significantly enhanced my productivity.

In addition to generating code, Copilot was instrumental in writing documentation for the project. It provided Javadoc comments for various classes and methods, ensuring that the codebase is well-documented and easier to understand for future developers. This was particularly useful for complex methods where detailed explanations were necessary. By automating the documentation process, Copilot helped maintain a high standard of code quality and readability throughout the project.

Moreover, Copilot was used to write this Markdown file, demonstrating its versatility beyond just code generation. It assisted in structuring the content and ensuring that the information is presented clearly and concisely. This capability is especially beneficial for creating project documentation, README files, and other textual content that accompanies the code. Overall, GitHub Copilot has proven to be a powerful assistant, enhancing both the development and documentation phases of this project.`

Ok thanks Copilot, what an objective and humble self-assessment there.

It was 98% used for menial things which I already knew how to do, such as writing tests and javadocs.

The remaining 2% was figuring out how to give Alice's responses broadcast stream behaviour (kinda like Flutter), where UI elements are actively listening for her responses. That was cool.

Huge boost in productivity indeed.
